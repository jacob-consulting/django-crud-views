# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-26)

**Core value:** Every public theme name settles once, consistently, before 1.0.0 freezes it — no public name changes twice.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Alert dismiss adapter

## Current Position

Phase: 4 — Alert dismiss adapter
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-26 — Phase 03 complete, transitioned to Phase 4

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 43%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in the PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: one roadmap phase per source-plan phase. Numbering: 1=1A, 2=1C, 3=1B, 4=3A, 5=3B, 6=2, 7=4.
- Roadmap: Phases 4 and 5 (plan 3A/3B) can be dropped if 1.0.0 ships early.
- Research: the 1A setting is read lazily from `django.conf.settings`, not as a Pydantic snapshot, so
  `override_settings` works.
- Phase 1 completed on `feat/label-mode-defaults`; user explicitly requested staying on the current branch.
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: Label-mode warn-once dedup is process-lifetime, keyed (location, repr(value)), no source dimension, no setting_changed reset; tests isolate via autouse conftest fixture
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: default_label_mode reads the raw setting every call (no merged-map cache); setting fallbacks return LABEL_MODE_DEFAULTS[location] directly so nested recovery terminates
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: E108 (Error, no hint) gives one message per bad entry in insertion order, unknown location before invalid mode; keys from button_data.LOCATIONS imported at check time
- [Phase 01]: 01-02: context floor resolves as target_default or default_label_mode('context'); list floor via explicit membership branch, never an eager dict.get default; W292 catches ValueError only around mode resolution so E108 survives strict check_viewsets
- [Phase 01]: Card chain is CardAction.label_mode, then no_label -> icon, then cv_get_card_actions_label_mode() (attribute, else default_label_mode('card')); no_label untouched (D-18)
- [Phase 01]: A valid explicit cv_card_actions_label_mode short-circuits the floor read, so an invalid strict card floor never raises for that view
- [Phase 01]: Label-mode precedence is stated once per location in action_menus.md (context/list/card resolution sections); other pages link instead of restating
- [Phase 01]: settings.md#label-mode-configuration is the single merge-or-replace table: CRUD_VIEWS_LABEL_MODE_DEFAULTS merges per location, per-action maps replace whole
- [Phase 01]: Card action rendering honors own instance values before the class resolver; own None reads the live card floor, while absent own values retain subclass fallback hooks.
- [Phase 02]: Form kinds accept all three class-key modes; context/list/card retain variants under independent immutable location allow-lists.
- [Phase 02]: Form class keys do not enable form label floors or change crispy rendering; those remain Phase 6 work.
- [Phase 03]: Filter toggle resolves cv_get_action_label_mode('context', self.key, self) with no target default; leaf falls back to the legacy icon body for absent/unknown modes
- [Phase 03]: list.filter.js unchanged: label-only markup is covered by its empty icon loop, collapse-first ordering and non-rollback persistence
- [Phase 03]: Review fixes supersede A1: malformed resolved filter modes use the shared strict exception or warn-once/context-floor policy before label rendering; startup diagnostics remain.
- [Phase 03]: Preserve a button's resolved mode only in context rendering; list rows always resolve their own mode. Review regression fixed in b78b3d1; 4/4 UAT and 22/22 verification checks passed.
- [Phase 03]: 03-02: filter toggle change is released as Fixed (#262), not Breaking; default output unchanged, migration guide still updated for copied templates
- [Phase 03]: 03-02: documented per-page filter override is view-level cv_context_buttons with FilterContextButton imported from crud_views.lib.view.buttons (no re-export)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Ruff 0.16.10 is below the manifest range and global formatting flags seven pre-existing planning
  Markdown files; product formatting passes. See phase deferred-items.md and WINDOWS entry 4.
- Phases 6 and 7: each needs a spec or maintainer decision before planning.
- Phase 7: retain the decided stable label-mode names; track the separately planned `no_label` removal before 1.0.
- Phase 5: confirm the hidden-label key name (`pagination:hidden-label` vs `table:hidden-label`) before Phase 7.
- Phases 4, 5 and 6 must commit before-change goldens. Today's goldens contain no form buttons, dismissible alerts or
  table pagination.
- Phase 2: Both source-probe classifier limitations remain documented; explicit tests and completed human prose UAT independently establish acceptance. See 02-VERIFICATION.md.
